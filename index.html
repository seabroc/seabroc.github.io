        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Cameron Seabrook and I am majoring in Computational Science. Coming into high school I was very
            interested into Business Management but growing up I enjoyed setting up any electronics in my household. As
            time went by my parents asked if I considered majoring into something that involves computers.</p>
        <h1>For those who are upcoming student who are majoring in Computational Science it takes these steps to
            understand the logistics of programming</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Every chance you get, you need to attend every class period to update your knowledge.</li>
            <li>In those classes you need to follow along with the instructor to get a better understanding on what you
                need to do, to be a great programmer.
            </li>
            <li>After class or during your free time, if there is any trouble you can ask for help and follow some of
                the book examples.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your skills will start to improve during you time taking the course, getting yourself familiar with the
            materials to program on your own.</h3>
